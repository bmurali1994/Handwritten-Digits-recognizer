# Handwritten-Digits-recognizer
Classifying Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset using various Machine Learning Algorithms.
The code are matlab scripts. All the files are self explanatory with comments.

The following classifiers were used for classification:
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks with two hidden layers of 10 neurons each
- K Nearest Neighbors for classification:
   compared how the value changes based on the factor- 'k', results are available in the graph
- Ensemble of decision trees: 
   compared how the accuracy changes as the number of base classifiers increased.
